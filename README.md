# CJ Learn Inventory Solution

_not the only one :)_

This is an example implementation of the CJ Learn Codeschool project,
https://github.com/cjlearn/learn-inventory.  If you are a CJ Learn
student and were assigned the inventory project, use this solution
for inspiration if you are really stuck but use it sparingly because;

0. Part of learning is struggling to understand. That way you internalize
it in your own way. If you look at someone else's code and say "I get it"
then just use that code, it is likely that your understanding is
superficial
0. When you go to pair with a CJ engineer, your understanding of your own
code will be expected. The questions you get about it may be subtle and
you will want to know exactly why you wrote each line of your solution
and be able to defend your decisions.

If, instead, the inventory problem is being worked out in-class and your
assignment is a different problem, use this project as practice for reading
other people's tests and source code. For each test, make sure you can
describe what it proves. If you can't, bring it up in your next session as
a discussion item.

Note also that this implementation has only the latest tests and code. The
current solution was derived after many iterations of red-green-refactor
(take a look at the commit hitory, paying attention to how many lines have
been deleted) and its current design is more code than is needed for the
initial feature cycles and is thus wholly unsuitable for use during your
own RGR cycles.
